What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
----using version control we can revert back to previous version if anything goes wrong with the new changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
